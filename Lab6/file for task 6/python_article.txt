Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. Guido began developing Python during the Christmas holidays of 1989 while working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to design a language that was easy to read and pleasant to use — one that combined the power of existing programming languages with human-friendly syntax.
Python was officially released to the public in 1991, as version 0.9.0. It already included essential features such as exception handling, functions, and modules — as well as the first implementation of Python’s unique indentation-based syntax. Guido named the language “Python” not after the snake, but after the British comedy group Monty Python’s Flying Circus. He wanted programming to feel playful rather than mechanical.
Over time, Python evolved through major versions — Python 2 (released in 2000) and Python 3 (released in 2008). The transition from Python 2 to Python 3 was a bold but necessary move that modernized the language for the future, improving Unicode support and simplifying syntax.
